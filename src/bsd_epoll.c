 * bsd_epoll.c - Linux epoll.h emulation via kevent API
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2009 Boaz Harrosh <bharrosh@panasas.com>
 * All rights reserved.
 *
 * Inspired by code written by Roman Divacky
 * from the freebsd's linux emulation project at linux_epoll.c file
 * However none of that code ended up here.
 *
 * description:
 *    This file implements a workable set of the <sys/epoll.h> header file
 *    on a linux distribution. The implementation translates back and forth from
 *    epoll calls and constants to Kevent calls and constants.
 *
 *   This file is copyrighted under the "New BSD License" (see below) so it can
 *   be included in the tirpc library project.
 *   But I fully expect that if you make any fixes/enhancements to bsd_epoll.c
 *   you shall send these changes to me for inclusion in the next version.
 *   (Or I'll hunt your dreams, and you will not have peace)
